# raylib-tests

My attempts to use raylib from various languages that I haven't created full bindings for. The reasons that I haven't created full bindings may include time (due to extra work being necessary to properly bind the library), because I am only evaluating the language in question, or simply because they aren't needed.

This currently includes code for using raylib from:

* [Lumi](https://github.com/meircif/lumi-lang)
* [Scopes](https://hg.sr.ht/~duangle/scopes)
