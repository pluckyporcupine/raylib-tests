How to run:

* Install [Scopes](https://hg.sr.ht/~duangle/scopes) (instructions [here](https://scopes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation))
* Grab [the latest release](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases) of raylib (the mingw version, if on Windows)
* Copy raylib to your bin/include/lib folders (in the `mingw64` folder, if on Windows)
* Run `scopes <file>`

Building an executable is a lot more complicated right now.
